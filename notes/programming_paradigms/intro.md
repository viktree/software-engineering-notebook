## :pushpin: What are we talking about? Imperative & Declarative.

<p align="justify">
Programming isn't only about coding. In fact, coding might be only "how" and neither "what" or "why". And you know what? No solution is made with only "how". That's why we need some tools and concepts to do not good but great code. Paradigms are one step behind that. They dictate what solutions look like, so we can choose "how" while we have "what" and "why" in the macro scope of the problem.

<p align="justify">
There are two domains we talk about when thinking of programming: the problem domain (whatever human business topic) and the solution domain (whatever we do to achieve sucess solving the problem). It might seem kinda dumb, but it's essencial. Programming is basicaly mapping those human problems through abstract solutions and translate them as instructions so computers can be able to do what they're supposed to in this context. We can call the distance between real world problems and computers abstract solutions as "semantic gap".
</p>

<p align="justify">
As you can see at the image above, the declarative programming paradigm is closer to our problem, real world, domain while the imperative paradigm is far away from it. This means that it might be easier to translate our problems into declarative languages, 'cause of the tools for abstraction they allow us to use (such as classes and objects). In another perspective, the imperative paradigm is closer to the assembly, computer's native languages, which means we have less work for compiling these instructions. Tools are functions and data structures.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Languages which support imperative programming paradigm are command oriented ("sit down"), in this case a program is a sequence of commands and commands update data structures. This gets our abstractions closer to the concepts valiable in assembly languages, but harder to represent human problems. Languages which support declarative programming paradigms are oriented by descriptions ("today is monday and the day is cloud"), the statements describe the way things are in certain problem domain. Solution-domain objects actually represent problem-domain objects and in this case, a program is about defining the properties and behaviour of these.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Despite those two paradigms are the major ones, each of them has subcategories. We'll introduce them as our next steps listed below.
</p>

## :bomb: TL;DR

<p align="justify">
There are two major programming paradigms: <b>(1) imperative</b> - tells the computer how to do, so it's faster to compile but less flexible to represent human's problems & <b>(2) declarative</b> - tells the computer what to do, so it's slower to compile but more flexible to represent human's problems. Languages can support one or both of them.
